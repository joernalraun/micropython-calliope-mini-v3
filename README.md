MicroPython on the Calliope mini via CODAL (TigerJython Build)
======================================

This is a port of MicroPython to the Calliope mini V3 which uses the CODAL as the
underlying target platform. This port is a fork of [Micropython](https://github.com/microbit-foundation/micropython-microbit-v2) for the BBC micro:bit V2. The steps to compile this software are the same.

Setting up
----------

After cloning this repository update the submodules:

    $ git submodule update --init

Then build the MicroPython cross-compiler:

    $ make -C lib/micropython/mpy-cross

Note: you may need to add to the line above `PYTHON=python` (or some variant
thereof) to select your Python executable (this defaults to `python3`); for
example:

    $ make -C lib/micropython/mpy-cross PYTHON=python

Building and running
--------------------

After setting up, go to the `src/` directory and build
(as above, you may need to add `PYTHON=python` to the `make` command):

    $ cd src
    $ make

That will build both `libmicropython.a` (from source in `src/codal_port/`) and
the CODAL app (from source in `src/codal_app/`).  The resulting firmware will be
`MICROBIT.hex` in the `src/` directory which can be copied to the micro:bit.

Once the firmware is on the device there will appear a REPL prompt on the serial
port.  To test it you can run:

    >>> display.show(Image.HAPPY)
    >>> audio.play(Sound.HAPPY)
